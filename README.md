# 🚀 Void Nova

- **A top-down adventure shooter with a focus on exploration, created with Unity as a school assignment project.**

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Randomized Enemy Spawns on a Vast Map**
  + Every playthrough is a new experience, with enemies spawning in random locations across a wide, open map.

- **High-Speed Combat with Dash and Ultimate Skills**
  + Experience the thrill of fast-paced maneuvering with a dash ability and the satisfaction of wiping out enemies with a powerful ultimate attack.

- **Strategic Navigation with a Minimap**
  + To help navigate the large map, the minimap displays enemy locations, allowing you to strategically plan your route and objectives.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

* **Language** : C#
* **Tools Used** : Unity, Visual Studio, Adobe Photoshop
* **Development start date** : 2025.6.27

## 🎮 How To Play

The player's aim is controlled by the mouse direction.
- **Movement** : WASD
- **Fire** : Spacebar

Enemies will begin to fire as you approach them, so use the minimap to track their positions.\
Defeating enemy fighters will slightly increase your ultimate gauge, while destroying enemy bases will charge it significantly.

While you can defeat all enemies, the primary mission is to ***destroy all enemy bases*** to complete the game.
